# BitBounty

BitBounty is a revolutionary funding platform that empowers users to distribute monetary donations to donors with ease and transparency. Traditional businesses often face challenges in transparency and automation, but BitBounty addresses these issues through the use of smart contracts and zero-knowledge computing.

## Key Features

- **Transparent and Automated Funding**: BitBounty leverages smart contracts and zero-knowledge proofs to create a transparent and automated system for rewarding contributions.
- **Support for Open-Source Developers**: The platform supports open-source development across all blockchain ecosystems, including The Graph, by ensuring transparent distribution of governance tokens.
- **Integration with GitHub and Web3**: BitBounty seamlessly integrates GitHub achievements with Web3, recording developers' accomplishments on the blockchain transparently.
- **Recognition of Past Contributions**: The platform acknowledges past contributions, ensuring appropriate funding opportunities through open contributions.
- **Zero-Knowledge Recognition**: By using the GitHub API and zero-knowledge recognition, BitBounty provides a reliable system where contributions are fairly rewarded.

## How It Works

1. **Transaction Initiation**: When users perform transactions such as funding or closing an issue, the BitBounty contract requests data from GitHub via ChainLink Functions.
2. **Data Retrieval and Storage**: ChainLink Functions retrieve the data from GitHub and store the results on IPFS.
3. **Data Processing**: RISC Zero processes this data, and zero-knowledge proofs verify the computations.
4. **Funds Distribution**: The calculated results are sent back to the BitBounty contract, which then distributes the funds accordingly.

## Verification with ZKPass

BitBounty uses ZKPass to verify GitHub accounts within a smart contract. This verification ensures that funds are distributed to the correct user, maintaining the integrity and accuracy of the funding process.

## Benefits

- **Enhanced Transparency**: Every transaction is recorded on the blockchain, ensuring complete transparency.
- **Automation**: Smart contracts automate the distribution of funds, reducing manual intervention and errors.
- **Fair Reward System**: Contributions are evaluated and rewarded fairly, fostering a healthy open-source ecosystem.
- **Blockchain Integration**: Developers' achievements are recorded on the blockchain, creating a permanent and verifiable record of their contributions.
